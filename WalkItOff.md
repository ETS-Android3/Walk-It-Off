**#1. Introduction**

WalkItOff is a lifestyle app that allows individuals who struggle with mornings, to fundamentally change how they handle beginning their day. WalkItOff utilizes location services to pinpoint user location. Users will set an alarm, and must walk a set distance utilizing the GPS coordinates in order to shut the alarm off. Further implementations include a hi score system, to facilitate competition and further motivation amongst users. The app will eventually have a leveling system, that will allows users to select earned sounds as new alarms based on prior successful uses of the app.

In retrospective our team found themselves learning far more than anticipated. There was a general consensus that the proper use of and knowledge of tools such as IDE’s API’s etc, are paramount and cannot be emphasized enough. We found that tracking and motivating individual developer performance can have challenges aswell.
