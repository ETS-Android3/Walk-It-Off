#**1. Introduction**
====================================================================================
WalkItOff is a lifestyle app that allows individuals who struggle with mornings, to fundamentally change how they handle beginning their day. WalkItOff utilizes location services to pinpoint user location. Users will set an alarm, and must walk a set distance utilizing the GPS coordinates in order to shut the alarm off. Further implementations include a hi score system, to facilitate competition and further motivation amongst users. The app will eventually have a leveling system, that will allows users to select earned sounds as new alarms based on prior successful uses of the app.

#**5. Code Quality**
====================================================================================
1. Use good naming conventions - We try to name variables and methods in a concise manner that's short but also gives 
   a clear indication to what the purpose is.  
2. Clean formatting - All code is formatted to have aligned blocks and brackets so that new readers can tell how the code
   is structured. 
3. Code for Readability - The code is read by more than one member of the team so that readability is ensured. Complicated
   code can be difficult to read, and makes it difficult for developers to work with. 
4. Implement comments on things that may require knowledge - We try to limit the length of comments unless something must 
   be explained in plain English. In general the code should be readable to the average reader without needing too much commentary. 
5. Communicate to the others if you are modifying a class - Communication is key in the group, and this is because it is easy for
   group members to independently work on the same task, without talking with one another. We try to assign roles during every meeting
   so that each members understands his role, and there's no overlap in work. 
6. Leave a to do list in the main class - This is so that anyone working on development can see what needs to be done, or what 
   has already been done. 


#**6. Lessons Learned**
====================================================================================
1. The use of SQLite may be advantageous in the future for small applications such as this.
2. The Server implementation is very vulnerable and more work would be needed to ensure security for app users.
3. The more you plan, the less issues you will face later down the road.
