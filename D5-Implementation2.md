#**1. Introduction**
====================================================================================
WalkItOff is a lifestyle app that allows individuals who struggle with mornings, to fundamentally change how they handle beginning their day. WalkItOff utilizes location services to pinpoint user location. Users will set an alarm, and must walk a set distance utilizing the GPS coordinates in order to shut the alarm off. Further implementations include a hi score system, to facilitate competition and further motivation amongst users. The app will eventually have a leveling system, that will allows users to select earned sounds as new alarms based on prior successful uses of the app.

#**5. Code Quality**
====================================================================================
1. Use good naming conventions 
2. Clean formatting 
3. Code for Readability 
4. Implement comments on things that may require knowledge
5. Communicate to the others if you are modifying a class

#**6. Lessons Learned**
====================================================================================
1. The use of SQLite may be advantageous in the future for small applications such as this.
2. The Server implementation is very vulnerable and more work would be needed to ensure security for app users.
3. The more you plan, the less issues you will face later down the road.
