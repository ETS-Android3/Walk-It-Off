# **1. Introduction**

WalkItOff is a lifestyle app that allows individuals who struggle with mornings, to fundamentally change how they handle beginning their day. WalkItOff utilizes location services to pinpoint user location. Users will set an alarm, and must walk a set distance utilizing the GPS coordinates in order to shut the alarm off. Further implementations include a hi score system, to facilitate competition and further motivation amongst users. The app will eventually have a leveling system, that will allows users to select earned sounds as new alarms based on prior successful uses of the app.

How would you compare this app to others like it?
I usually go back to sleep with these kind of apps, but I probably wouldn't [go back to sleep]
with the walking aspect. Unlocking new sounds also makes it a bit more fun.

What would you change about the app?
I mean, the log in page is a bit confusing, and I'd also like to see how much farther left I have to go.
Also I get it's incomplete, but wouldn't closing the app disable the alarm?

On a scale of 1 to 10, how likely would you continue using the app?
7

**Results:**
The user believed that the concept behind the app would help him get up earlier. It's something he
would use if he struggled to get up early, but would go back to a normal alarm clock app once he feels
satisfied with his sleep schedule.

**Reflections:**
This app adequately addresses the problem of struggling to wake up at a desired time, although interest
in this app seems to depend on if a user struggles with the problem at a given moment. As it currently stands,
I would think that users would stop using the app as soon as their problem is solved, and go back to it should they
ever have the same problem again.
