# **1. Introduction**

WalkItOff is a lifestyle app that allows individuals who struggle with mornings, to fundamentally change how they handle beginning their day. WalkItOff utilizes location services to pinpoint user location. Users will set an alarm, and must walk a set distance utilizing the GPS coordinates in order to shut the alarm off. Further implementations include a hi score system, to facilitate competition and further motivation amongst users. The app will eventually have a leveling system, that will allows users to select earned sounds as new alarms based on prior successful uses of the app.




# **2. Verification**

## **2.1 Unit Test**

## **2.2 Acceptance test**

**2.1.1** we used JUnit4 for our tests.

**2.1.2** Link: https://github.com/aidenhalili/CS386-Project/tree/main/app/src/test/java/com/example/walkitoff

**2.1.3** For the alarm feature, we implemented a test to make sure that it would go off at the right time. The input is always 0-2 minutes ahead of current time.

# **3. Validation**

**User 1:** Courtney Maxwell

**Interviewer:** Nickolas Maxwell

**Script:**
User set alarm, and moved set distance to deactivate alarm.
User uploaded results to DB via DBConnect
How would you describe the UI of the app? Simple, But easy to use.
How does our app compare to the one you currently use? Its very different.
On a scale of 1 to 10, how likely are you to continue using our app? 2

**Results:**
User seemed uninterested in continuing the use of app. User expressed interest in the
capabilities. 

**Reflections:**
It seems this app is highly niche, and should be targeted towards 
those who wish to live a more active lifestyle.

**Script:**
How would you compare this app to others like it?
I usually go back to sleep with these kind of apps, but I probably wouldn't [go back to sleep]
with the walking aspect. Unlocking new sounds also makes it a bit more fun.

What would you change about the app?
I mean, the log in page is a bit confusing, and I'd also like to see how much farther left I have to go.
Also I get it's incomplete, but wouldn't closing the app disable the alarm?

On a scale of 1 to 10, how likely would you continue using the app?
7

**Results:**
The user believed that the concept behind the app would help him get up earlier. It's something he
would use if he struggled to get up early, but would go back to a normal alarm clock app once he feels
satisfied with his sleep schedule.

**Reflections:**
This app adequately addresses the problem of struggling to wake up at a desired time, although interest
in this app seems to depend on if a user struggles with the problem at a given moment. As it currently stands,
I would think that users would stop using the app as soon as their problem is solved, and go back to it should they
ever have the same problem again.

**User 3:** Phillip Krigbaum 

**Interviewer:** Justin Stouffer 

**Script:** Question 1: How would you describe the layout of the app?
Answer: I think the layout is overall clean, and easy to navigate and see. The only dislike I really have is that the login and set alarm buttons are not centered. 

Question 2: Do you like the ability to change the theme/is this something you would use?
Answer: Yes, I think that is a nice feature and while I do like the light theme better, I think having the option is still very convenient. More themes would also be nice.

Question 3: How likely would you be to use this with the current layout and functionality?
Answer: I would rate this as an 8.5 or 9/10 based on how the app is right now. 

Question 4: What do you think of the highscore functionality? 
Answer: I think it is pretty rough right now, but I really like the idea. I think it would be a good idea to have the login saved, so that you don't have to login each time, and also it would be nice to have a separate highscore tab. It would be a good idea to have more of a scoreboard type style, with different categories such as furthest distance, fastest time, etc. Achievements would also be a cool feature. 


**Results:** Overall, the user liked the concept of the idea and would consider using it. They do think that the current build of the app is a little rough, such as the layout and high score page but they are satisfied with the functionality of the app. 

**Reflections:** The apps base functionality proves to be useful to people, but fixing the app layout and design would attract many more users. It is also proven to be geared towards a niche gorup of users who need something more useful than their currrent alarm, and would like more of a challenge.
