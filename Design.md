The WalkItOff app has two components, the MYSQL database, and the Android application. Similar to the examples given we have split these into two packages.Classes are also listed as packages within the larger packages, these represent the individual classes and their respective functions,which will help facilitate the display of the interconnectivities. The dotted lines serve to represent the individual connectivities between class packages.
